## Posts:
THis is currently the design of the posts. A jumbotron of the description of the picture after the picture and title. Tags are at the corner. Previous and next buttons allow users to travel without going back to the portfolio page or filtering again. When there are no more newer posts, next will disappear. When there are no more older posts, previous will disappear. Otherwise, both will appear.
